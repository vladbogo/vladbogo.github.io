Depth Anything offers a practical approach to depth estimation, specifically monocular depth estimation where depth is estimated from a single image. This has far-reaching applications in fields like self-driving cars and virtual reality. Instead of relying on hard-to-obtain labeled images, Depth Anything leverages a large dataset of 62 million regular images for training. This allows it to predict depths accurately across a wider range of situations.

## Architecture

The main strategy behind Depth Anything is to make the most of unlabelled images. It uses a two-part "teacher-student" approach. First, a 'teacher' model learns from a smaller set of images that _do_ have depth labels. Then, this teacher model helps generate approximate depth labels for a much larger set of unlabeled images. This expanded dataset trains the 'student' model.

**However, there's a twist: Challenging the Student**

To ensure the student truly learns from the extra images new information, the process gets more complex. The unlabeled images get heavily altered â€“ think extreme color changes and distortions. This forces the student model to find stable patterns and better understanding visual cues.

Zero-shot results

The method can also be fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as metric depth estimation or semantic segmentation.
