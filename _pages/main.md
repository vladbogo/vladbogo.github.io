**Short bio:** I am a Software Engineer at the MariaDB Foundation and I am exploring AI fact-checking at [Filtir](http://filtir.com). I am interested in developing novel methods and tools for verifying the accuracy and reliability of information in the digital age.

## Research highlights

### AI Content Fact-Checking
- Currently part of Filtir, a startup dedicated to the fact-checking of AI-generated content.
- Aiming to ensure the accuracy and credibility of information in the age of AI, focusing on combatting misinformation.
- Building algorithms capable of cross-referencing and validating data against trusted sources.

### Text-Video Retrieval
- Focusing on understanding the limitations of text-video retrieval methods.
- Introduced hubness mitigation strategies and developed systems that achieve leading results on benchmarks.
- Collaborated with the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford.

### Object Segmentation and Detection
- Focused on unsupervised learning, more exactly transferring knowledge from video to images
