**Short bio:** I am an AI Engineer at [Mantic](https://mantic.com), where I work on building AI systems for forecasting future events. Previously, I was an AI Engineer at [FlowX.AI](https://flowx.ai), where I used LLMs to automate banking app development, and I conducted research with the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford on text-video retrieval.

## Research Highlights

### AI Forecasting
- At [Mantic](https://mantic.com), I work on automating judgmental forecasting across geopolitics, business, policy, technology, and culture.  
- Our systems are inspired by human *superforecasters*, but aim to deliver predictions at unprecedented accuracy and scale.  
- See the [launch post](https://www.mantic.com/launch) for more on how weâ€™re pushing the frontier of AI forecasting.  

### AI Content Fact-Checking
- At [Filtir](http://filtir.com), focused on fact-checking AI-generated content.  
- Built algorithms for cross-referencing and validating data against trusted sources to combat misinformation.  

### Text-Video Retrieval
- Researched the limitations of text-video retrieval methods.  
- Introduced hubness mitigation strategies and developed systems achieving leading results on benchmarks.  
- Collaborated with the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford.  

### Object Segmentation and Detection
- Worked on unsupervised learning, specifically transferring knowledge from video to images.  

## Engineering Highlights

### FlowX.AI
- Worked as an AI Engineer using LLMs to automate the creation of complex banking applications.  

### MariaDB
- Led the creation of MariaDB's automated [testing framework](https://buildbot.mariadb.org).  
- Ensures compatibility and testing across multiple platforms and operating systems for the MariaDB Server.
